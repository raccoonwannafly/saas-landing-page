# solution-landing-page
## Saas Landing page built with Bootstrap
- Initially I was going to go full copy mode and make the landing page the exact same as the design, however I decided to go off road to try and make some changes myself regarding the color scheme and elements. Also to fiddle with Canva, the result are the prototype images.
- Fully responsive
- Initial design: https://dribbble.com/shots/21447445-SAAS-Marketplace-Website-Design
